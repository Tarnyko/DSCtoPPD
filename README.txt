DSCtoPPD is a converter from Project Diva Arcade Future Tone charts (.dsc files) to PPD project/layer files (.ppd)

---HOW TO USE---

Either drag and drop the .dsc file to "DSCtoPPD.exe" or execute in cmd and give .dsc file path as argument
Choose which porting method you want to use (input 1 or 2), press enter, that's it ! Result in output folders
Don't forget to put your own "movie.mp4" to replace the automatic one that is just a blank 10 seconds movie

---WHAT IS SUPPORTED---

-All note data (including chain slides, same direction slides, notes parameters) in layer file
-BPM changes as a script (BPM.fsml) (will not modify bpm in the editor but only in real gameplay)
-PPD Project/PPD layer port
-data.ini auto filled (end time, start time, bpm etc...)

---WHAT IS NOT SUPPORTED---

-Chain slide scales (I'm just too lazy to understand events for now)
-Score port (will have to open in editor, copy difficulty and publish to play in game, I'll try to add this later)
-Multiple difficulties (just convert your first difficulty to a full project and all others to layer files, then open layers in your projects as difficulties)
